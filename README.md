## UI Automation Suite | Kid Problems
This repository showcases vairous test frameworks to validate the Kid Problems web application (refer to the repo here: [kid-problems](https://github.com/chongtian/kid-problems)). 

### Test Projects
- **kid-problem-ui-test-playwright** UI Test project based on playwright
- **kid-problem-ui-test-selenium** UI Test projects based on Selenium Webdriver
  - **KpUiTestNUnit:** Test runner is NUnit.
  - **KpUiTestxUnit:** Test runner is xUnit.

### Some thoughts
I can see why people say **Playwright** is a superior UI testing framework now that I’ve started writing tests with it. Its built‑in auto‑waiting and native parallelism make UI testing significantly smoother and more reliable.
